- Spyder- running from cmd line- arguments to the script --- makes the script generic and can work on any fileExercies with Python Scripting and command line:Our goal is to learn running Python scripts fromcommand line.1) Learn how to read arguments to your Python script.import sys=====2) Read the file "usa_state_capitals.csv"=====3) Call your Python script "process_state_capitals.py"=====4) Running the script as follows:./process_state_capitals.py 2 usa_state_capitals.csvshould output column 2 to the screenSimilarly, ./process_state_capitals.py 4 usa_state_capitals.csv=====5) Screen for state names ending with the specified letter.Example:./process_state_capitals.py a usa_state_capitals.csvshould output all state names ending with letter "a"(Hint: Use regex)=====6) Update latitude and longitude in the file./process_state_cpitals.py latlon usa_state_capitals.csvshould add 1 to all latitudes and 2 to all longitudes.print output to the screen=====7) Extract the line from the file if the city capitalis not a single word. Write the output to a file.Call it "capitals_with_spaces.csv"
